# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz â€“ Tressa Park

I built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Rules are:

(yes) GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
(yes) WHEN I click the start button
(yes) THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
(n/a) WHEN I answer a question
(no) THEN I am presented with another question
(no) WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
(no) THEN time is subtracted from the clock
(no) WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
(n/a) THEN the game is over
(n/a) WHEN the game is over
(no) THEN I can save my initials and score
